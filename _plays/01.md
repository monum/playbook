title: Stop sending sales people
---

We’ve got nothing against sales people. Many of us have sold things. But we’re getting calls every day from “IoT” vendors and we’re really tired of talking to your sales teams. We don’t even know why or how we’d use your product. You might think that your technology is ready for prime-time, but we’re not ready to buy it and put it up all over Boston. At some point, we’ll know what we need and we’ll need someone to talk to about dollars and cents, feature roadmaps, etc. Right now, in 2016, there are much bigger questions unanswered.

So send us someone who knows about cities, someone who wants to walk in the shoes of our City workers or talk to residents about what they love (and don’t love!) about Boston. Send us someone who’s looking for more than a 30-minute pitch or a relationship to manage. We’d love to have a relationship with you—but it needs to be a real one.

### Key Questions
- How does your product address the questions and concerns in this playbook?
- Do you have examples--real ones, not marketing documents--of how your product has worked elsewhere? And examples of where and why it's failed, too?
- Can you differentiate your sales team by giving them access to content knowledge about cities?
- How are you addressing concerns of security, privacy and accessibility?
- How do we ensure that the devices can be maintained and that we aren't simply adding to our landfill in 5 years time?
