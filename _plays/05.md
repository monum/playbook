title: Platforms make us go ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Over at [theclevercity.net](http://theclevercity.net/), Ross Atkin writes: "The Smart City is a top-down all or nothing proposition. We can start building the Clever City bottom-up with one lamppost, bus stop or parking space (and of course one problem). Maybe one day we will join up all the individual Clever City services and will have a Smart City. Maybe we never will, but the Clever City can make a real difference to people’s lives right now."

It’s too early for platforms. We don’t know what kinds of sensors we’ll use in Boston over the next 10 years, who will build them, what technical standards they’ll adhere to, and where they’ll go. We also don’t know how they’ll be networked, where they’ll store data, and who they’ll serve it to. As a City, we’re not in the business of making bets on what technology standards will prevail. (It’s why we’re working with the National Institute for Standards & Technology as part of our work.) Until those standards are clear and until we have a better idea of the technical landscape, we don’t need or want a “smart city platform."

### Key Questions
- What's your smallest installation footprint? How does it scale from 1 to 10, not just 10k to 100k?
- How is your product being made “future-proof” and inter-operable with other technologies and standards?
- What standards would you like to see adopted in the "Smart City" landscape? How are you pushing those standards forward?
